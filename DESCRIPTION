Description: This package is used to estimate smooth survival curves (and time-to-event curves) using a penalized log-likelihood function (sBIC) to determine an optimal smoothing bandwidth as described in our manuscript. When data are interval-censored, we employ the method of Turnbull (1976). When observations are exact, we follow the method of Kaplan & Meier (1958).
